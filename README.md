Baseball is America's Pastime. Over the past century, the game's rules have only changed three times. In 1961, Major League Baseball (MLB) changed the season from 154 games to 162, and in that same year, Roger Maris broke Babe Ruth's record of hitting 60 home runs, but he had an additional eight games to do it which was a significant change. In 2008, instant replay started allowing on-field challenges, which could have changed the outcome of the World Series in 1985. In 2021, the Low-A (A+) West Division within Minor League Baseball (MiLB) began implementing a "Pitch Clock Timer" during the fifth week of the season with specific rules to help speed up Baseball games which had average game times of over 3 hours. In 2023, MLB began implementing the pitch timer rules used by the A+ MiLB, resulting in a decreased average of 28 minutes played per game. This paper uses a Differences-in-Differences (DID) model to show whether the PitchTimer affects variables other than time in the game. Specifically, does the PitchTimer increase the Batting Average of a hitter?# GitCowboy
